# Homepage surface-area audit

What proportion of a homepage is spent on brand, navigation, routing and promotion.
Phases 1 and 2 only: capture a page and cut it into blocks. Classification and
reporting are not built yet.

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `capture.mjs` | Phase 1 CLI. Loads a URL at 1440×900 and writes the screenshots, DOM rects and meta. |
| `segment.mjs` | Phase 2 CLI. Turns a screenshot into a block tree and a debug image. |
| `lib/capture.mjs` | `capturePage()` — the Playwright run. The Craft job will import this, not the CLI. |
| `lib/consent.mjs` | The cookie-banner selectors, and one attempt at dismissing them. |
| `lib/edges.mjs` | Greyscale → Sobel → non-max suppression → hysteresis. A Canny edge map. |
| `lib/xycut.mjs` | Density profiles, gutter finding, the recursive partition, and tall-page tiling. |
| `lib/blocks.mjs` | The `Block` shape and `assertPartition()` — the invariant everything rests on. |
| `lib/debug.mjs` | The screenshot with every block outlined. The review gate. |
| `fixtures/` | Committed captures the segmentation tests run against. See its own README. |
| `test/` | `node --test tools/audit/test/` |

```sh
node tools/audit/capture.mjs https://example.com /tmp/audit   # phase 1
node tools/audit/segment.mjs /tmp/audit                       # phase 2, depth 4
node tools/audit/segment.mjs /tmp/audit --depth=6             # cut further
node --test tools/audit/test/                                 # unit + fixture tests
AUDIT_LIVE=1 node --test tools/audit/test/                    # plus the network smoke test
```

## Gotchas

- **The viewport is locked at 1440×900.** Every committed fixture was captured at it,
  and every number in the tests assumes it. Changing it means recapturing the lot.
- **Artefacts go outside the repo.** Nothing under `tools/` is gitignored, and a
  full-page screenshot of a commercial homepage is several megabytes. `outDir`
  defaults to `/tmp/audit`. The fixtures are the deliberate exception.
- **A consent banner we fail to dismiss is not a failure.** It is part of that page's
  surface area and should be measured as such. `meta.json` records which happened.
- **Open `debug.png`.** The tests prove the tree is a valid partition. They cannot
  prove it is a sensible one.

## The rule this tool defends

**A block's children exactly tile it.** Splits land at the gutter midpoint and every
pixel goes to one child or the other, so total leaf area equals image area at every
depth.

That is the measurement, not tidiness. Trim blocks to their content instead and the
gutters fall out of every leaf, so cutting a nine-card grid into nine blocks quietly
shrinks the measured area of that grid and inflates the unassigned residual — the
headline percentage would then move with `--depth`, which is indefensible in a report
somebody is reading about their own site. With a true partition, depth changes which
labels get applied and never the arithmetic.
